### Seeding the database

- The local SQLite database is seeded automatically with exercises and muscles when the app starts.
- To manually trigger seeding, call the `SeedDatabase` function from `db/seed.tsx` in your code.

Example (already included in `app/index.tsx`):

```tsx
import { SeedDatabase } from "../db/seed";

useEffect(() => {
  const runSeed = async () => {
    await SeedDatabase();
  };
  runSeed();
}, []);
```
