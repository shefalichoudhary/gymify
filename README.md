# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

## Instructions to run on your development machine

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Expo development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start

   ```

3. **Choose your platform**
   - Android emulator (start from Android Studio)
   - iOS simulator (requires macOS)
   - Expo Go app on your mobile device (scan the QR code)
   - Development build

> **Tip:** For Android, you may need to start an emulator from Android Studio first.

### ðŸ§  Manually Seed the Database

To manually seed the local SQLite database, run:

```bash
npm run seed
```

3. **what it does**
   - Executes the script located at db/seed.tsx using the tsx runner.
   - Inserts all exercises and their related muscles into the local SQLite database.
   - Automatically links each exercise to its target muscles with their assigned roles (e. g., primary, secondary).
   - Displays progress and a success message in the terminal when the seeding is complete

### Build a development standalone app (EAS)

To build a development version for Android or iOS:

```bash
npx eas build --profile development --platform android # for Android
npx eas build --profile development --platform ios  # for iOS

```

## Development Process for Dev Development

Follow these steps to run and develop the app locally:

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Prepare your device or emulator**
   - **Android:** Start an emulator from Android Studio before running the app.
   - **iOS:** Use the simulator (requires macOS).
   - **Physical device:** Install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code.

3. **Start the Expo development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   - This starts the Metro bundler in your terminal or VS Code.
   - You can edit code in the app directory and hot reload will reflect changes immediately.

4. **Choose your platform in the Expo CLI**
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Scan the QR code for Expo Go

5. **Install the app on your device or simulator**
   - After the build, install the APK (Android) or IPA (iOS) on your device or emulator.

6. **Keep the Metro bundler running**
   - The app connects to the dev server for live reload and debugging.
   - Any code changes in VS Code will hot reload in your installed dev build.

7. **Debug and test**
   - Use console logs or React Native Debugger to inspect the app.
   - Seed the database as needed during development (see instructions above).
   - Commit changes frequently and push to your repository.
